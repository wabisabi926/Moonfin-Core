## Features

- **One codebase, every screen** spanning phones, tablets, desktop, Android TV, Apple TV, web, and Samsung TV, with navigation tuned for touch, pointer, and remote.
- **Broad playback support** through AetherEngine on iOS, Apple TV, and macOS, native Media3 by default on Android and Android TV with libmpv  available as a backup, libmpv on Windows and Linux, and the browser's own player on web, covering AV1, HEVC, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, and bitstream audio passthrough. Dolby Vision Profile 7 direct plays on both Apple and Android TV, converted in real time instead of transcoded. See [Playback and Codecs](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Moonfin-Core/wiki/Playback-and-Codecs).
- **Offline downloads** in original or server-transcoded quality, with automatic folder organization and offline subtitles. See [Downloads](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Moonfin-Core/wiki/Downloads).
- **Ebooks and audiobooks** with EPUB, MOBI, AZW/AZW3, PDF, and comic archive reading, plus M4B audiobooks with chapter navigation.
- **Retro games** browsed and played in-app from a server game library, with native libretro playback, gamepad support, and synced save states. See [Retro Games](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Moonfin-Core/wiki/Retro-Games).
- **Multi-server unified library** that merges content from several Jellyfin and Emby servers into one browsable, searchable UI, with Group By options and quick return to the top.
- **A setup wizard on first run** that asks how you want the app to look, with live previews built from your own artwork, and skips anything you have already chosen.
- **Featured media bar** with six layouts, Moonfin, MakD, Bookshelf, Gallery, Banner, and the rounded Aya hero, plus optional in-bar trailer previews.
- **Themes and Theme Store** with a built-in editor, server-side sync, and an OLED mode for true blacks.
- **Integrated admin panel** for settings, users, libraries, logs, devices, and analytics without leaving the client, plus a messages window for what your server admin sends you.
- **Discovery with Seerr** built into the media details screen, plus trending, popular, and upcoming rows with request status overlays.
- **Live TV and DVR** with an EPG-style guide and recording management.
- **Trickplay scrubbing** as a single thumbnail, a filmstrip, or full screen, with prefetching and configurable size and placement, on both Jellyfin and Emby.
- **Cinema Mode and segment skipping** for pre-rolls, intros, credits, and SponsorBlock.
- **Casting and remote control** over Google Cast, DLNA, and AirPlay, plus control of other Jellyfin devices on your network.
- **SyncPlay** for synchronized group watching.
- **Personal ratings** as a like, five stars, or a score out of ten, shown alongside the other rating sources and usable to sort or filter a library.
- **Ratings from MDBList and TMDB**, home row customization, parental controls with PIN, and in-app update checks.
