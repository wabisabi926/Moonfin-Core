// The window mpv renders HDR video into, on Windows.
//
// media_kit's texture path allocates B8G8R8A8_UNORM and mpv draws into it
// through the OpenGL render API, so every HDR stream is flattened to 8-bit SDR
// before Flutter composites it. target-colorspace-hint cannot fix that: it tags
// a swapchain, and on the render API mpv owns none. So mpv needs a window of
// its own, which is what this creates - the runner owns lifetime and geometry,
// mpv creates and owns the D3D11 swapchain once it is handed the HWND.
//
// The window comes in two arrangements, chosen by MOONFIN_HDR_DWM - parsed
// once, on the Dart side, and handed over with the `create` call:
//
//  - Default (technique 2; MOONFIN_HDR_DWM=1..4 picks another): a top-level
//    window *behind* the whole runner window, with the runner window given
//    per-pixel DWM transparency (see
//    hdr_window_support::ApplyTransparencyComposition for the techniques).
//    Flutter draws everything - controls, dialogs, OSD - natively over the
//    video, and no capture is needed at all.
//  - MOONFIN_HDR_DWM=0: the fallback - a child HWND *above* the Flutter
//    view. Flutter's UI is then re-composited over the video by
//    hdr_overlay_window, because nothing shows through the Flutter view from
//    below.

  // |on_window_changed| fires whenever the native window appears or goes
