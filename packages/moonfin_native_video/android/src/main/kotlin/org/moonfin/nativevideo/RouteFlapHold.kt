/**
 * Decides what a bitstream sink does while its HDMI route flaps.
 *
 * A link renegotiating at playback start reports the audio sink gone for a
 * few seconds and then back. Media3 answers that two ways and both end with
 * the passthrough track on a decoder: a write to the dead track throws an
 * error the player recovers from by reselecting against a sink that has lost
 * its capabilities, and a paused player hears the capabilities change and
 * reselects on its own.
 *
 * So a dead bitstream track is held rather than reported, and a capabilities
 * loss is deferred rather than forwarded, both for at most [maxHoldMs] from
 * whichever came first. The route coming back inside that window ends it with
 * nothing forwarded, since the renderer never learned anything changed. Past
 * it the error is rethrown or the loss forwarded, which is what the player
 * did before any of this existed.
 *
 * The caller owns the clock, so the logic stays a plain object a JVM test can
 * drive.
