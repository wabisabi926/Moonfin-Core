/**
 * Owns the native libretro input path end-to-end: physical gamepad/keyboard
 * events go straight from [MainActivity.dispatchKeyEvent] /
 * [MainActivity.dispatchGenericMotionEvent] through here to
 * [LibretroBridge.onPad] with no binder IPC, no boxing, and no Dart channel
 * crossing on the hot path.
 *
 * A custom binding on a device simply overwrites that keycode's slot in its
 * preflattened [IntArray] (built once, on mapping change or first sight of a
 * device) -- so a remap beating the fixed D-pad/button layout is structural,
 * not a guard clause (see task B2, preserved from [GameInputRouter]'s old
 * `handlePhysicalDpadKey`).
 *
 * D-pad/trigger state from physical keys and from the analog HAT/trigger axes
 * are two independent bit sources ([keyMask] / [motionMask]) that are OR'd
 * together per RetroPad bit before being forwarded -- releasing the HAT while
 * the digital key is still held (or vice versa) cannot clobber the other
 * source's held bit. The per-frame OR-latch on the native side (added
 * alongside this change) guarantees a same-frame press+release is still
 * observed by the core, so no reconciliation beyond that OR is needed.
 *
 * Controller-mapping capture (the pause menu's "press a button to bind it"
 * flow) runs concurrently with an active native session -- the mapping panel
 * is opened *from* the pause menu of a running game, so `active == true` and
 * capture-armed are simultaneously true, not exclusive states. [onKey] checks
 * [captureActive] before Start/Menu/table dispatch specifically so capture
 * wins: a key that would otherwise be swallowed as gameplay input, or
 * special-cased as Start, is captured as a binding instead while armed.
 *
 * [event.deviceId][KeyEvent.getDeviceId] is a per-connection int that
 * changes when a controller disconnects and reconnects; persisted bindings
 * are keyed by the stable vendor/product/descriptor hash from
 * [AndroidGamepadIdentity] instead. [buildTable] is the one place that
 * resolves deviceId -> stable id (one [InputDevice.getDevice] call), and it
 * only runs on a [deviceTables] cache miss -- first sight of a deviceId,
 * right after [setControllerMappings] invalidates the cache, or after a
 * device add/remove/change invalidates just that id. Every other event is a
 * plain array index.
